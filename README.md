Attractors Part 2
-----------------

Two strange attractors, based on Mathematics from the book Elegant Chaos (2010) by J.C.Sprott.

To run right click the ".py" file, open with Idle 3 and choose "Run->Run Module". Requires Python 3 / Idle to be
installed (not tested with Python 2).

Note: arrays are not used as the dimensions are fixed and it would make the code harder to read.
